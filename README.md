# Oni View

This viewer uses image assets from the [oni-seed-browser](https://github.com/MapsNotIncluded/oni-seed-browser) project.
To keep this repository lightweight, the icons are not stored here.
Run the script below to download them into the `assets/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/download_assets.sh
```

Once downloaded, you can build and run the viewer normally.
